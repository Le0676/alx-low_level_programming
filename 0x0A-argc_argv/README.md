In the C programming language, argc and argv are command-line argument variables that are passed to the main() function when a program is executed from the command line.

argc stands for "argument count" and is an integer variable that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It includes the name of the program itself as the first argument, so argc is always at least 1.

argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings (i.e., an array of character pointers) that represents the actual command-line arguments. The first element of argv (argv[0]) is always a string containing the name of the program, while subsequent elements (argv[1], argv[2], etc.) represent the additional command-line arguments passed to the program.

In summary, argc and argv are important command-line argument variables in the C programming language that allow programs to receive and process arguments passed to them from the command line.
