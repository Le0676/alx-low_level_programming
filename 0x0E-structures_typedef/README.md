C is a structured programming language that allows programmers to define their own custom data types using structures and typedefs.

A structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine different data types (such as integers, floating-point numbers, and characters) under a single name. A structure declaration typically begins with the keyword "struct" followed by a name for the structure and a list of member variables enclosed in curly braces.

Once a structure is defined, you can create variables of that structure type just like any other data type

To access the member variables of a structure variable, you use the dot notation
You can also define a typedef in C, which allows you to create an alias for a data type. This can make your code more readable and easier to maintain.

Overall, structures and typedefs in C are powerful tools for creating custom data types that can make your code more organized and easier to read.
