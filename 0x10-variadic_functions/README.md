In C, a variadic function is a function that can accept a variable number of arguments. The keyword used to define a variadic function is ... which represents the variable arguments.

The standard library includes variadic functions like printf() and scanf() that accept a variable number of arguments.

To call this function, you would specify the number of arguments being passed, followed by the arguments themselves

Variadic functions can be quite powerful, but they can also be tricky to use correctly. It's important to ensure that you have the correct number and types of arguments, and to properly handle any errors that may occur.
