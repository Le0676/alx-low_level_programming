In C, a function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function. Function pointers can be used to pass functions as arguments to other functions, to return functions as values from functions, and to create arrays of functions.

Function pointers can be used in a variety of ways, such as implementing callback functions, dynamic binding, and function dispatch tables. They are a powerful feature of the C language and are widely used in systems programming and low-level programming.
