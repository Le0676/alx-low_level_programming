0x09-static_libraries

Static libraries, also known as archives, are collections of object files that are linked with a program at compile time. They contain precompiled code and data that can be reused by different programs. When a program is linked with a static library, the object code of the library is copied into the resulting executable file.

Static libraries have several advantages. They are easy to use because they don't require any additional setup or configuration, and they are generally faster than dynamic libraries because they don't have the overhead of loading and unloading code at runtime. Additionally, since all the code is compiled into the executable, static libraries make it easier to distribute a program because you only need to distribute a single file.

However, there are also some downsides to using static libraries. They can increase the size of the resulting executable file, which can be a problem for embedded systems or mobile devices with limited storage capacity. Additionally, because the code is compiled into the executable, any changes to the library require recompiling the entire program.

Overall, static libraries can be a useful tool for developers, particularly when developing small or self-contained applications. However, they may not be the best choice for larger projects where code modularity and flexibility are important.
